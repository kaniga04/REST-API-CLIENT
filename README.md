DESCRIPTION: This Java application demonstrates how to consume a public REST API to fetch and display weather data for a given city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and wind speed.

The application allows users to input their city name, sends a request to the API, and parses the response to display the data in a structured and user-friendly format.
